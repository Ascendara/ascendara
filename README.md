> With Ascendara, you can easily download, manage, and play pre-installed games without needs to go through the hassle of extracting, installing, and moving files. Ascendara's game list comes from a custom webscraper which for now only has games from [STEAMRIP](https://steamrip.com/), but plans for more sources later on

# Building the app
### Note: The Ascendara API requires a key which is private as of now. Game browsing will not function properly.

1. Build the React app
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    This will build the app in `src` into a single index, css, and js file. Look in `src/dist` for the files.

2. In the dist, move the assets folder into the parent folder

3. In the index.html file of the built react app, you will see "assets/index.css", and "assets/index.js". Simply remove the "assets/" leaving just the file
   name in the source.

4. Move all files into the `build` directory

5. Build the Electron app
   ```sh
   npm run dist
   ```
