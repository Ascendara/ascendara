Ascendara simplifies your pirating experience by providing a seamless way to download, manage, and play the pre-installed games. No more hassle with extracting, installing, or moving files. The game library is powered by a custom webscraper, currently featuring games from [STEAMRIP](https://steamrip.com/), with plans to expand to more sources.
