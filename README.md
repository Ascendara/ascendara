> With Ascendara, you can easily download, manage, and play pre-installed games without needs to go through the hassle of extracting, installing, and moving files. Ascendara's game list comes from a custom webscraper which for now only has games from [STEAMRIP](https://steamrip.com/), but plans for more sources later on.

# Building the app [(view wiki)](https://github.com/tagoWorks/ascendara/wiki/Running-as-a-Developer)

1. Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tagoWorks/ascendara.git
    ```

2. Install requirements
    ```sh
    npm install -r
    ```
    
3. Build the React app
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    This will build the app in `src` into a single index, css, and js file. Look in `src/dist` for the files.

4. In the dist, move the assets folder into the parent folder

4. In the index.html file of the built react app, you will see "assets/index-########.css", and "assets/index-########.js". Simply remove the "assets/" leaving just the file
   name in the source.
   "########" being a random string of characters
6. Move all files into the `build` directory

7. In the main.js, go towards the bottom and delete `mainWindow.loadURL('http://localhost:5173/')`, and uncomment `mainWindow.loadURL('file://' + path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'));` in order to run correctly

8. Build the Electron app
   ```sh
   npm run dist
   ```
