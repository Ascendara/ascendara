Ascendara Installer
======================

The Ascendara Installer is currently in beta development. It provides a modern, user-friendly 
interface that runs on top of the classic installer process.

This installer is still in development (beta). While it provides a beautiful interface, 
it primarily serves as a UI wrapper for the underlying installation process. Future versions will 
include more advanced features and improved installation handling.

Note: This is a beta release. Please report any issues or feedback through the GitHub repository.
